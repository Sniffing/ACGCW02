\section{Part 1: Fresnel reflectance}
Using the equations outlined in the notes for Fresnel reflectance,
the graph depicting parallel and perpendicular components of air to glass
(or some other material with a refraction index of 1.5)
which was a refraction index of 1.0 to 1.5 and can be seen in Figure 1. The
graph of Fresnel Reflectance from glass to air (1.5 to 1.0) is shown in 
Figure 2. The curve for Schlick's approximation of Fresnel
reflectance is seen in Figure 3. These can all be found in the "part1" folder
in the pictures folder of the attached files.\\
\\
From air to glass, we took the parallel component measurements and found
Brewster's angle to be \texttt{0.9837 radians}  ($56.3636\degree$).

\end{figure}

From glass to air, we took the parallel component measurements and from here
could owrk out the critical angle to be \texttt{0.7299 radians} 
($41.8182\degree$).

Finally, with Schlick's approximation, we made sure to use the reflectance
of normal incidence from the air to glass Fresnel reflectance graph which 
was $0.04$ from ($0.2^{2}$).

\section{Part 2: Environment Map(EM) sample generation}
The samples we took from the environment map can be see in 
\texttt{pics/part2/sample*.pfm} and \texttt{pics/part2/sample*.ppm} in the 
attached files. For each sample pixel, we have surrounded it with a $9$ pixel 
neighbourhood for better visualisation. 
\\
We have done sampling with the number of samples, \texttt{N}, being $64$, $256$
and $1024$. The steps we followed were approximately the same as discussed in the
lectures. First we calculated the average luminance of each row of the environment
map, stored them in an array. Then we normalised the array so that the sum of the 
terms will add up to $1$. After we made a cumulative sum of the array so it will 
serve as a cumulative density function. This is done in the very similar manner
on each row.\\
To sample, we then generated two random variables $u$ and $v$ between $0$ and $1$.
We have to first find out which row $u$ is coming from, in other words, the first
index from the luminance array that is greater than $u$. We noticed that since
array is a cumulative density function, it is a increasing array. So we can 
devise a binary search algorithm to find the index more efficiently. Similarly, this 
technique can be done on when locating which column $v$ is coming from too.\\
This method is faster than the usual linear search on the array, since the complexity
is \texttt{log} in terms of the array size and the other method takes up to 
linear time.

\section{Part 3: Environment Map(EM) Sphere Rendering}



\section{Part 4: Rendering a Sphere with Grace EM and PBRT}
Albedo was set at 1.0 and the three sphere can be seen in the
"part4" folder of the "pics" folder attached. These are the
.pfm and .ppm images named "simplesphere8", 
"simplesphere16" and "simplesphere32" for the 8,16, and
32 sample sampling methods.
As we can see from these images the general amount of noise 
decreased quite noticeably from 8 to 16 samples and again 
decreased from 16 to 32 but less noticeably.
